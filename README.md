This project represents my first full attempt at creating a SPA with JQuery Mobile. Basically, it is just a 
digital version of a hand-written grocery list kept on the refrigerator. Items can be added and deleted
as required and then emailed to designated recipients.

Long term goals:
1) Rewrite front-end with Angular and bootstrap.
2) Move controller and model logic to server-side and implement in Mongo and Node so that it can be accessible and 
   interactive over the internet.
